This project should be able to be pulled verbatim into a ForgeGradle 1.2 (1.7.10) dev environment.
All that should be required to compile is a simple 'gradle build', or a 'gradle jar' for a dev build.

The Glass Pane build.gradle also adds a new task; 'delombok', as we use Project Lombok. To run it, just do 'gradle delombok'.
A new folder will be created called 'delombok' with the delomboked sources in it.

You will need Kitchen Sink, from http://github.com/AesenV/Kitchen-Sink to compile Glass Pane, as well as Project Lombok, from http://projectlombok.org
